# CodeIgniter
A repository for my contributions to an amazing PHP framework.

## What is CodeIgniter?
**The website sums it up perfectly.**
> ...a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, **built for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications**.

I can't agree less. The CodeIgniter framework can be found at https://www.codeigniter.com/

## My Libraries
